Thank you for downloading this asset pack, I hope you will find what you are looking for!

Keep up on your game dev journey, you will succeed in making the game you want :)

As explained in the itch.io page, credits are not mandatory, so feel free to use it in any way you want.
However, I am curious to know which projects are using any of these tracks, so let me know if you have made something with it!


Best!
